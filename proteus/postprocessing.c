    combine example in Chen '94 paper and Chou and Tang '00 paper to
    take scalar finite element function, assuming it's from NC_Affine
    ...  space and compute an RT0 velocity. 

    This version includes a piecewise constant 'gravity'/advection
    term, f as well as mass and source terms that may not be computed
    using L_2 projection. It also likely only holds for diagonal tensor A.

    This means that we lose the correspondence with RT_0 mixed finite
    element approximation, but should still be able to get a velocity
    in RT_0 that's locally conservative (and has continuous normal
    fluxes).  Chou and Tang show that their approach should still
    converge to the correct solution O(h) I believe.

    Velocity (Darcy flux) definition is
  
     q =  -A\grad u + \vec f 

    where \vec f wouldy be \rho A\vec g, A is the (diagonal) 
    conductivity \vec g is gravity and \rho is a density.
    
    A and f need to be evaluated as the 'averages' aka L_2 projections
    on element-wise constants. Note that in the P^1_nc weak formulation, we get

     (A_h\grad u_h,\grad w_h)_E = (\bar{A}\grad u_h,\grad w_h)_E 
     (f_h,\grad w_h)_E          = (\bar{f},grad w_h)_E

    for a diagonal A, since \grad u_h and grad w_h are constant on E.

    Weak formulation for P^1_nc should be

    (m_{h,t},w_h) + \sum_{E}(A_h \grad u_h,\grad w_h) - \sum_{E}(f_h,\grad w_h)_E + 
       (r_h,w_h) = (s_h,w_h) - <q^b,w_h>_{\Gamma_N}


    Where, q^b = total flux on Neumann boundary

    To represent the RT0 velocity, we use
    
      \vec q_h = \vec a_E + b_E\vec x 

    which turns out to be on triangle E

      \vec q_h = -\bar{A}_h\grad u_h + \bar{\vec f}_h + 
             (\bar{s}_E-\bar{r}_{E}-\bar{m}_{t})/d(\vec x - \vec x_{E}) + \vec c_{E}

    The scalar b_E is determined exclusively by the mass-conservation constraint:

      b_E = (\bar{s}_E-\bar{r}_{E}-\bar{m}_{t})/d

    and the constant \vec a_{E} comes about through normal flux continuity condition 

        \vec a_T = -\bar{A}_{h,E}\grad u_h + \bar{\vec f} - b_E \vec x_{E} + \vec c_E
    
    To get the correspondence with the RT_0 solution, we have to use L^2 projections for
    the mass, reaction, and source terms. Otherwise, we can still choose \vec c_E to enforce
    continuity of the normal fluxes.

    To solve for \vec c_E, we solve a d x d system on each element

      \mat{G}_{E}\vec c_E = \vec j_E

       G_{E,i:} = |e_i|\vec n_i, the unit outer normal for face i times its area/length
  
       j_{E,i}  = (s_h - r_h - m_{h,t},N_i)_{E} - |E|(\bar{s}-\bar{r}-bar{m}_t)/(d+1)

    where the integral (,)_{E} and averages should be computed with
    the same quadrature used for the P^1_nc solution, N_i is the test
    function that's 1 on e_i. For Dirichlet boundaries, we set j_{E,i}
    = 0

    
    In the notation
        \bar{s}_{E} is the average source over element E
        \bar{r}_{E} is the average reaction term
        \bar{m}_{t,E} is the average accumulation term
        \bar{\vec f}_{E} is the constant advection (gravity) term
        \bar{A}_{h} is the average diagonal conductivity over E
        \vec x_{E}  is the element barycenter
         d is the spatial dimension

    assumes that solution holds all degrees of freedom and boundary
    values.
 
    Note, r array holds -s + r terms.

    returns array rt0vdofs that's nelements by nd+1, that stores
       rt0vdofs[eN,:] = [\vec a_E,b_E]

      \mat{G}_{E}\vec c_E = \vec j_E

       G_{E,i:} = |e_i|\vec n_i, the unit outer normal for face i times its area/length
  
       j_{E,i}  = (s_h - r_h - m_{h,t},N_i)_{E} - |E|(\bar{s}-\bar{r}-bar{m}_t)/(d+1)

    where the integral (,)_{E} and averages should be computed with
    the same quadrature used for the P^1_nc solution, N_i is the test
    function that's 1 on e_i. For Dirichlet boundaries, we set j_{E,i}
    = 0

    
    In the notation
        \bar{s}_{E} is the average source over element E
        \bar{r}_{E} is the average reaction term
        \bar{m}_{t,E} is the average accumulation term
        \bar{\vec f}_{E} is the constant advection (gravity) term
        \bar{A}_{h} is the average diagonal conductivity over E
        \vec x_{E}  is the element barycenter
         d is the spatial dimension

    assumes that solution holds all degrees of freedom and boundary
    values.
 
    Note, r array holds -s + r terms.

    returns array rt0vdofs that's nelements by nd+1, that stores
       rt0vdofs[eN,:] = [\vec a_E,b_E]

 try to put in version of Swedish Postprocessing with Neumann boundaries
  enforced explicitly and NodeStarFactorStruct data type

  This version, 
    skips flux boundaries in element integrals: calculateConservationResidualPWL,
                                                calculateConservationJacobianPWL

    sets row 0 of flux boundary nodes jacobian to Id and rhs to 0:
           calculateConservationJacobianPWL, calculateConservationFluxPWL

  When using this version, 
     do not remove boundary flux terms from element residual
     must load in boundary fluxes into ebq_global velocity and ebq velocity
      after calling

  Note,
    fluxElementBoundaries holds global exterior element boundary ids for flux bcs
    fluxElementBoundaryNodes holds global node numbers for flux bcs

/***********************************************************************
  version of Swedish Postprocessing with internal Neumann boundaries
  enforced explicitly 

  This version, 
    skips flux boundaries in element integrals: calculateConservationResidualPWL,
                                                calculateConservationJacobianPWL


    also will use this with routines that do NOT modify jacobians for
      node-stars since it uses dgetc2 Lapack routines that have column
      pivoting and can handle the simple singularity

  When using this version, 
     do not remove boundary flux terms from element residual
     must load in boundary fluxes into ebq_global velocity and ebq velocity
      after calling

  Note,
    fluxElementBoundaries holds global element boundary ids for flux bcs
