# This matrix was generate from a RANS2P simulation of the broad-crested weir problem

  * Model step t=0.1
  * dt = 4.47285e-03
  * Maximum CFL = 0.657
  * 29593 triangles and 15080 nodes (he = 0.01)
  * Weakly enforced, default boundary condtions
  * Uses nonconservative form of the NSE
  * Full SUPG stablization
  * Viscosity / density values: default air-water values
  * This comes from the initial Newton iteration
