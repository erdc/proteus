# This matrix was generate from a RANS2P simulation of the two-phase step problem.

  * 55630 triangles and 28193 nodes
  * Strongly enforced free-slip boundary condtions
  * Uses nonconservative form of the NSE
  * Pressure-projection stablization
  * Viscosity / density values:
    rho_0 = 1.0 #1.205 / 998.2
    nu_0 = 1.0 / 50.
    rho_1 =  1.205 / 998.2
    nu_1 = (1.0/50) * ( 1.500e-5 / 1.004e-6)
  * This comes from the initial Newton iteration (e.g. it solves a stokes like problem)
