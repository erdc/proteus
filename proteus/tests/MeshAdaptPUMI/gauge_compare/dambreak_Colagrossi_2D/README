This test is to ensure that the restart process after adapt is working properly with 

1) RANS2P lagged subgrid error
2) RANS2P lagged shock capturing
3) lagged eddy-viscosity
4) Lagged shock capturing for VF and LS
5) LAG_LES=1.0 for dynamic smagorinsky

This is for the nonconservative form of NS and for adaptive time stepping.
Oddly, fixed time stepping yields slight differences on the order of 1e-14 which throws off the current (simple) method for comparison.
