Proteus (http://proteustoolkit.org) is a Python package for
rapidly developing computer models and numerical methods.

# Installation



```bash
conda install proteus -c conda-forge
```

For a development installation, you want to install Proteus's dependencies and compile Proteus from source:

```bash
conda env create -f environment-dev.yml
conda activate proteus-dev
make develop-conda # or pip install -v -e .
```

You can also build proteus and dependencies from source (without conda) with 

```bash
make develop
make test
```

See https://github.com/erdc/proteus/wiki/How-to-Build-Proteus for more information on building the entire stack.
