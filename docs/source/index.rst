Introduction
============

Proteus is a Python package for rapidly developing computer models and
numerical methods. It is focused on models of continuum mechanical
processes described by partial differential equations and on
discretizations and solvers for computing approximate solutions to
these equations. Proteus consists of a collection of Python modules
and scripts. Proteus also uses several C, C++, and Fortran libraries,
which are either external open source packages or part of Proteus, and
several open source Python packages.

The design of Proteus is organized around two goals:

* Make it easy to solve new model equations with existing numerical methods
* Make it easy to solve existing model equations with new numerical methods

We want to improve the development process for models *and*
methods. Proteus is not intended to be an expert system for solving
partial differential equations. In fact, effective numerical methods
are often physics-based. Nevertheless many physical models are
mathematically represented by the same small set of differential
operators, and effective numerical methods can be developed with minor
adjustments to existing methods. The problem with much existing
software is that the physics and numerics are completely intertwined,
which makes it difficult to extend (and maintain). In Proteus the
description of the physical model and initial-boundary value problems
are nearly "method agnostic".  This approach has been used in the
developement of a variety of mathematical models and numerical
methods, both of which are described in more detail below
(:ref:`capabilities-sec`).

Obtaining and Installing Proteus
================================

For learning and experimenting there is a
`Docker image <https://cloud.docker.com/u/erdc/repository/docker/erdc/proteus>`_.
Proteus can be installed through conda with:::

  % conda install proteus -c conda-forge

Proteus is available as source from our public
`GitHub <https://github.com/erdc/proteus>`_
repository. For a development installation, the installation of
dependencies and the compilation of Proteus from source is done with:::

  % git clone https://github.com/erdc/proteus
  % cd proteus
  % conda env create -f environment-dev.yml
  % conda activate proteus-dev
  % pip install -v -e .

Alternatively, if you already have compilers (C,C++, and Fortran!)
installed on your system, you can install Proteus through hashdist
with the following commands:::

  % git clone https://github.com/erdc/proteus
  % cd proteus
  % make develop
  % make test

More information is available on our `Wiki <https://github.com/erdc/proteus/wiki>`_, and you can ask for help on
the `Developers' Mailing List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/proteus-dev>`_.

.. _running-sec:

Running
=======

If you have successfully compiled and tested Proteus then you should be able to do::

   % cd $PROTEUS/tests/ci
   % $PROTEUS_PREFIX/bin/parun poisson_3d_p.py poisson_3d_c0p1_n.py

The solution will be saved in a file ending in .xmf, which can be
opened with ParaView or Ensight.

Additional tools are included for pre- and post-processings meshes and
solutions files generated by Proteus and other models, including methods for
obtaining locally-conservative velocity fields from :math:`C_0` finite
elements.

.. _release-sec:

Release Policy
==============

The releases are numbered major.minor.revision

* A revision increment indicates a bug fix or extension that shouldn't break any models working with the same major.minor number.
* A minor increment introduces significant new functionality but is mostly backward compatible
* A major increment may require changes to input files and significantly change the underlying Proteus implementation.

These are not hard and fast rules, and there is no time table for releases.
