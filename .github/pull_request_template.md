# Mandatory Checklist

Please ensure that the following criteria are met:

[ ] Title of pull request describes the changes/features
[ ] Request at least 2 reviewers
[ ] If new files are being added, the files are no larger than 100kB. Post the file sizes.
[ ] Code coverage did not decrease. If this is a bug fix, a test should cover that bug fix. If a new feature is added, a test should be made to cover that feature.
[ ] New features have appropriate documentation strings (readable by sphinx)

As a general rule of thumb, try to follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines.
