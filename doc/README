This is the root directory of the documentation. The documentation is
built from reStructuredText and the python docstrings using sphinx. To
build the html type 'make html' or see the Makefile for additional
formats. The documentation starts in index.rst and is organized as a
tree using the toctree entry in each .rst file. The api, scripts, and
test docs are/will be generated from the docstrings using the sphinx
autodoc extension. See the files in api and tests for examples. Note
that for autodoc to work the python interpreter must have access to
the files. The scripts and test/problemDescriptions paths are thus
appended in conf.py so that these modules, though not part of the
proteus module, are accessible to python during the sphinx build
process.
